# ðŸ¤– Auto Job Emailer using n8n + OpenAI

Automate your job search by analyzing job descriptions and generating personalized cold emails using **n8n** workflows and **OpenAI GPT** â€” no manual typing, no context switching.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project automates the process of creating **personalized cold emails for job applications**.

Whenever you come across a job description (JD) â€” on LinkedIn, Naukri, or elsewhere â€” simply send it to your n8n webhook.  
The workflow automatically:

1. Analyzes the job description using GPT.  
2. Extracts key details like job title, company name, HR email, and required skills.  
3. Generates a short, polite, and personalized cold email to send to the HR.  

ðŸš« *Note:* This version does **not attach resumes** â€” purely text-based email generation.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### Webhook Node
Receives the job description text as a JSON payload.

### GPT Node (HTTP Request or OpenAI)
Processes the text, extracts job details, and generates a personalized cold email.

### Response Node
Returns the GPT output in a clean JSON structure (or optionally sends it through Gmail).
